                <h1>Our Clients</h1>
                <h2>We are passionate about proper financial planning and prudent investment and our desire is to look after our clients and their money in a manner that delights them.</h2>

        <div>Introduction</div>
        <p>We are of greatest value to you as a client when:</p>
        <ul class="client_value">
            <li>You care about being a good steward of your capital.</li>
            <li>You need an independent expert on your side of the table.</li>
            <li>You need someone who will really listen to you and understand your overall objectives.</li>
            <li>You need someone to pay meticulous attention to the details of your finances.</li>
            <li>You want someone who can help look after your prospective beneficiaries' money.</li>
            <li>You want proper advice delivered with a clear rationale and in plain English.</li>
            <li>You are not sure whether the products or assets in which you are invested are right for you.</li>
            <li>You wonder whether your investments are delivering satisfactory returns for the risk taken.</li>
            <li>You want to know how to at least protect your capital and preferably grow it.</li>
            <li>You don’t know when to move into markets and when to come out of them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are just ten of the many needs you may have.</p>
        <p>You should expect to receive regular reports and fast turnaround times to your queries.  
        This should be at sensible and justifiable fee levels that reflect the work and the level 
        of expertise that is required, across the different disciplines of pensions, tax reporting, 
        estate planning, asset allocation, investment strategy and fund selection.</p>
        <p>We would love to help you and we will let you know if we are unable to do so at a transparent 
        and sensible price that is proportionate to your circumstances. We don’t sell products, and we will 
        fiercely guard our independence and your capital.</p>

            <div class="test_card">
                <div class="card_content">Our decision a few years ago to switch to Nick Fletcher and his team proved wise.  The service at London Wall Partners has continued to be efficient and highly organised, and our regular reviews have left me with a lot of confidence about the state of our overall financial position.  The advice is always clear and personalised and I have developed a high degree of trust in the quality of the team and the high standards to which they operate.  Most importantly, you have that sense that everything has been thought through properly and that the agreed actions will happen – I sleep easy in that knowledge!</div>

            </div>
            <div class="test_card">
                <div class="card_content">We are really pleased to have found a financial advisor who listens to our wishes and ideas and tailors a service to meet them. The process is straightforward and cost effective and is fully meeting our expectations.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="test_card">
                <div class="card_content">I had been mulling over transferring out of what seemed like a precious and untouchable final salary pension for over a year.  Not a decision to be taken lightly and without proper thought and advice. It seemed to be so obvious to me that I was sure I was missing something.  I responded to an ad in The FT (something I have never done before) to attend a seminar with London Wall Partners to debate the issues.  It was only then that I realised that I was not alone in making such a momentous decision.  From the moment I appointed LWP to provide formal advice and run the process they were efficient, knowledgeable, on budget and timely.  I found it particularly useful and reassuring that there was a real person available on the end of a phone line who actually knew what they were talking about.  A rarity in the pension's world.  A top notch and faultless performance all round.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="test_card">
                <div class="card_content">The great thing about LWP is that they are ‘all over it’ and are meticulous and rigorous in their analysis of your financial situation and portfolio and this, coupled with impressive portfolio performance, makes for a very powerful package.  I now need to rely on my investments for my income, so I needed to make sure that I was getting the best advice.  One of their tenets is to bring corporate discipline to private money, and each six months you get a full review, plus net worth balance sheet, which shows precisely what your overall investment performance (over each asset class) is for the previous six months.  I have never had that before from any adviser in such detail.</div>

            <div class="test_card">
                <div class="card_content">The service provided by London Wall Partners is amazing and exactly what I was hoping it would be.  The consumability and clarity of the advice given has greatly assisted my wife and I to make educated decisions on important matters in our lives and the written reports provide a great record we can reflect on in the future.  It is brilliant – thank you so much.</div>

            <div class="test_card">
                <div class="card_content">My wife and I were introduced to Nick Fletcher and his team at London Wall Partners by a great friend who is one of their existing clients.  We were seeking new advice and at our first meeting we were very impressed by the detailed and highly professional approach, which subsequently has proved highly beneficial to us.  We had no hesitation in transferring our business and all our portfolios to the care of LWP and are delighted with the results.  In our personal view this firm is the most honest wealth management team we have come across.  They are a delight to work with and we have already recommended them to others and indeed have no hesitation in commending them to anyone seeking serious financial advice.</div>
