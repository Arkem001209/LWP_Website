                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <h3>We have considerable experience and understanding of pensions, estate and financial planning, investment strategy and fund selection, as well as a passion to give 
                        clients the best advice possible, and to serve them well. The firm sets itself apart from its competitors by doing a large number of small things in a precise and  
                        extraordinary manner, in addition to the following strategic differences: </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Being truly independent;</li>
                        <li>Bringing together strategic financial planning with global investment advice;</li>
                        <li>Net worth performance reporting;</li>
                        <li>Using fixed fees or hourly rates to eliminate conflicts of interest; and</li>
                        <li>Being owned by the people that operate the firm day-to-day</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>London Wall Partners' mission is to provide the highest quality of truly independent, professional advice and service around an individual's personal financial situation, 
                        including the wider family. This level of service is provided within an independent partnership structure, which can focus solely on the needs of clients. The firm seeks 
                        to ensure that, in everything it does, its clients' interests are paramount.

                    <h3>We provide advice on all aspects of our clients’ personal financial situation, and take responsibility for the work that is involved in implementing and monitoring that
                        advice in a proactive and timely manner.</h3>
                    <p>We first take time to listen to you and understand your objectives, establish the totality of your current financial situation including the charges you are currently 
                        incurring, and provide recommendations and rationale in the context of your appetite for risk and liquidity needs. If you agree with our recommendations, we help you 
                        to implement them by preparing the documentation and acting as an intermediary with any third party providers as appropriate.
                    </p>
                    <p>Following implementation, we monitor and evaluate performance and report regularly. This process continues on an ongoing basis to take account of the dynamism of life 
                        and markets.</p>
