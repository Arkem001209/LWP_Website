                        extraordinary manner, in addition to the following strategic differences: </p>

                        <li>Using fixed fees or hourly rates to eliminate conflicts of interest; and</li>
                        <li>Being owned by the people that operate the firm day-to-day</li>

                    <h3>We provide advice on all aspects of our clientsâ€™ personal financial situation, and take responsibility for the work that is involved in implementing and monitoring that
                        advice in a proactive and timely manner.</h3>
                    <p>We first take time to listen to you and understand your objectives, establish the totality of your current financial situation including the charges you are currently 
                        incurring, and provide recommendations and rationale in the context of your appetite for risk and liquidity needs. If you agree with our recommendations, we help you 
                        to implement them by preparing the documentation and acting as an intermediary with any third party providers as appropriate.
                    </p>
                    <p>Following implementation, we  and evaluate performance and report regularly. This process continues on an ongoing basis to take account of the dynamism of life 
                        and markets.</p>
