        <h2>Global Investment Advice</h2>
        <p>We provide a global understanding of and insight into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Asset Allocation</li>
            <li>Investment Strategy</li>
            <li>Security and Fund Selection</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our approach to independant investment advice derives from a set of ten core investment philosophies and beliefs, which have been developed from our long experience in investment markets:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Asset Allocation is critical.</b> - The most significant decisions in the investment advice process stem from our conversations with our clients concerning their objectives
                and risk appetite. From these, we identify how their portfolio should be structured between cash, bond, equity and real assets such as real estate and commodities</li>
            <li><b>Diversification of investment portfolios offers a reduction in the volatility of the overall portfolio.</b> - We believe it is essential to spread the risk across a number of asset classes.</li>
            <li><b>A Global mindset is necessary to identify the most attractive investment opportunities, but also to properly understand developments in the UK</b> - The last few years has shown very clearly that the UK economy and its financial markets are hugely influenced and dependent upon events in Europe, the USA and Asia.</li>
            <li><b>Understanding and being on the right side of the secular economic trends is central to long term investment performance.</b> - In the first decade of this century, it was the rise of China and its impact on the world economy which was the key to a successful investment strategy, in the current decade it is the way in which levels of indebtedness globally move which will determine investment performance.</li>
            <li><b>In the shorter term, economies and financial markets tend to move in cycles.</b> - These cycles are closely linked to trends in expectations in growth and inflation, which underpins our investment strategy.</li>
            <li><b>We will only invest our client’s money in investments we have researched, understood, approved, can explain clearly to our clients and which we would invest in ourselves.</b></li>
            <li><b>We avoid complex and opaque investments and search for managers that can add value over time.</b></li>
            <li><b>The only certainty in an investment portfolio is the drag to performance from the fees and charges involved in managing it.</b> - Working at reducing fees without compromising performance, is the easiest way to improve returns.</li>
            <li><b>An approach based on value.</b> - Seeking to buy assets when their prices are low and sell when they are high is straightforward, sensible and most likely to deliver good performance.</li>
            <li><b>A long term approach seeking to make steady returns is ultimately more profitable (though a lot less exciting) than chasing the latest investment fashion.</b>
        </ol>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>Once the recommendations have been provided with the appropriate rationale, we provide assistance with the implementation. This involves organising the relevant documentation, acting as an intermediary with any third party providers as appropriate, following up to ensure the correct terms have been applied and recording data as necessary.</p>
        <h3>Monitoring and Review</h3>
        <p>We operate in accordance with our best execution policy, which is available on request.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of our policy, we regularly assess the third parties available to us to identify those that will enable us, on a consistent basis, to obtain the best possible result when arranging for the execution of our clients’ orders.</p>
        <p>The third parties that we use, also have responsibilities in relation to best execution and client order handling. We undertake periodic monitoring to make sure that they continue to meet our requirements. This review is carried out at least annually or whenever a significant change occurs that we feel could affect our ability to continue to obtain the best possible results for our clients.</p>
        
        <h2>Performance Evaluation</h2>
        <p>Our Investment team is dedicated to studying and analysing global markets from a macro-economic point of view. In addition, we analyse securities and funds with assistance from various outside agencies who provide information and analysis. </p>
        <p>The Investment Committee, made up of London Wall Partners and experienced industry practitioners, meets once a month (and ad hoc as necessary) and serves to act as a governance and accountability partner to rationalise, test and debate recommendations and decisions.</p>

        <h2>Regular Reporting</h2>
        <p>Once we have formally taken on a new client, we will prepare an initial report which clearly sets out the client's financial position and existing investment portfolio / holdings and provide recommendations and rationale in the context of their risk appetite and liquidity needs.</p>
        <p>On a regular basis, it is also important for our clients to understand how their investments are performing and to have a comprehensive record of their assets and liabilities. We therefore report formally, typically on a half yearly basis, but can provide reports on a more frequent basis as required.</p>
