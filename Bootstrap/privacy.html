        <br><br>For former employees, we will retain your personal data for a period of time after you leave our employment (see below for further details on data retention) on the basis of a legitimate business interest and / or your consent (as appropriate). This will allow us to satisfy our legal and regulatory obligations and / or provide you with any relevant tax, financial or other information (including for the purpose of any references) relating to your employment with us, as required.
        <br><br>Where sensitive personal data is required, we will obtain your consent in order to collect and process this information.

        <ul><br>Introducers, suppliers, providers and contractors</ul>
        The primary reasons for processing your personal data are (i) to facilitate communication between us (including making business referrals to each other, as appropriate), on the basis of a legitimate business interest and / or your consent, or, where a contract is in place between us, (ii) to manage / administer the contractual arrangements, and (iii) to monitor your performance in the provision of services to us.

        <br><br><strong>How do we ensure security of the storage and transmission of your personal information?</strong>
        <br><br>We have installed and regularly update our firewall and antivirus software. We also apply robust access and security controls to our IT systems and have in place resilient data encryption and storage protocols.
        <br><br>Unfortunately, transmission of information via the internet and email is not completely secure. Though we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet where the security is outside our control; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use appropriate and technical and organisational measures to try and prevent unauthorised access, unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction or damage.
        <br><br>Where it is necessary for your personal data to be forwarded to a third party we will endeavour to use appropriate security measures to protect your personal data in transit. The vast majority of personal data transfers will occur within the United Kingdom or wider European Economic Area (“EEA”). However, sometimes your personal information may be transferred outside the EEA. If we do so, we will ensure that suitable contracts and / or safeguards are in place with the relevant third parties.

        <br><br><strong>How long do we keep hold of your information?</strong>
        <br><br>In principle, your personal data should not be held for longer than is required under the terms of our client agreement with you (or in respect of employees, your employment contract, or in respect of suppliers, contractors and other professional organisations, any contract between us). However, we are subject to regulatory requirements to retain data for specified minimum periods. We also reserve the right to retain data for longer than this due to the possibility that it may be required to defend a future claim against us. In any event, subject to regulatory and legal requirements, we will not retain your personal data for longer than seven years past the time of your death or the end of our relationship. You have the right to request deletion of your personal data. We will comply with this request, subject to the restrictions of our regulatory obligations and legitimate interests as noted above.

        <br><br><strong>How can I access the information you hold about me?</strong>
        <br><br>You have the right to request a copy of the information that we hold about you. If you would like a copy of some or all of your personal information please email or write to us using the contact details noted below. A small fee may be payable by you (to meet our costs of providing you with details of the information we hold about you) and we may request proof of identity before we are able to disclose personal information to you.
        <br><br>When your personal data is processed by automated means you have the right to ask us to move your personal data to another organisation for their use.
        <br><br>We have an obligation to ensure that your personal information is accurate and up to date. If you believe that any personal information we hold about you is incorrect or incomplete, please contact us using the details below.

        <br><br><strong>Marketing and your mailing preferences</strong>
        <br><br>We would like to use your personal information to send you information about our products and services, seminars, events, newsletters, investment commentaries and technical notes that we think may be of interest to you, and will seek the relevant consent from you at the appropriate time.
        <br><br>If you have agreed to receive marketing information, you may opt out at a later date.
        <br><br>You have a right at any time to stop us from contacting you for marketing purposes. If you no longer wish to be contacted for marketing purposes, please contact us by email or post, or click on the unsubscribe link in our email marketing communications.
